A sample repository that i am working on to create a react reasponsive search - results tables. Using react virtualized table, because it is awesome and fast to render virtualized component.

This is a reoccuring problem that I face in every app, mostly the layout changes but the problem repeats. So creating a template that will help me go faster for ever !!!

Steps to run the app

npm install
cd semantic && gulp build
mv .\semantic\dist\ ./src/css
npm run start
